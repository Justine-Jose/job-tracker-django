# Job Tracker System

A simple full-stack web application to track job applications â€” built using **Django**, **Django REST Framework**, and a **vanilla HTML/JS frontend**.

This project helped me understand REST APIs, serializers, and how to build interactive, real-world applications with Django as the backend.
